Dear %salutation% %name%,

<p>
Due to a recommendation by the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) we are asking all employees to gradually
renew their passwords step by step over the next few weeks.
<p>

<p>
The change will take effect for you on <u>%currentDate+7%</u>. By this date, please have thought of a new password. <br />
<b>After %currentDate+7%</b>, you will be prompted to set your new password once when you log in <b>in Windows for the first time.</b><br />
<b>Please do not change your password independently before that.</b>
<p>

<p>
In the attachment you will find the security criteria for your new password.
You can also find further information on the subject of password security 
<b><a href="https://menten-it-services.de/de/blog/wie-waehle-ich-ein-sicheres-passwort">online in a blog</a></b>.
<p>


<p style="color:red;">
<u><b>Please note:</b></u> Your password is confidential so you should not share it with anyone.
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions, please contact us. We will be glad to help you.
<p>



<p>
With kind regards<br>
Your it administration team
